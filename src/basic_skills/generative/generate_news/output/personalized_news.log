Researchers found that individuals who consistently practiced meditation exhibited not only better mental well-being but also healthier gut bacteria composition.\n\nThe study, conducted over a period of two years, involved a group of meditation practitioners and a control group with no meditation experience. Participants underwent regular assessments of their gut microbiome composition and mental health indicators such as anxiety, depression, and stress levels.\n\nResults showed a significant correlation between regular meditation practice and improved mental well-being. Furthermore, the gut microbiome analysis revealed that meditation practitioners had a more diverse and balanced bacterial composition in their gut.\n\nThese findings not only highlight the potential benefits of meditation for overall health but also emphasize the importance of gut microbiome balance in maintaining mental well-being.'}
